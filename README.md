# Selenium Image Downloader

This project came to life when I wanted to download all images from an image based forum with just one click. For this I've decided to go with Selenium, as it is a flexible tool capable of doing the work automatically.
The app needs to be given a link to the website from which it downloads images, and has been coded to suit my needs of downloading from a certain forum. Why isn't it optimised to download from any website?
The answer is: Different websites use different ways of attaching and storing images and the system would have to be very versitile to cover all of it. From my experimentation it works on some websites, but on others it fails to notice the images. That being said it only really needed to work on one website, therefore some exceptions were coded it specifically because of that. For example I wanted to avoid downloading small user icons, as they were of no interest for me.
All in all the app even though not professional, does it's job and I'm happy it works mostly the way I want it to.
